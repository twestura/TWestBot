# TWestBot

Rather than use Nightbot or StreamElements, I figured it would be more fun to create my own bot.
Uses TypeScript for now.
In the future I may rewrite the bot in Rust if I feel like having more fun.

Uses `tmi.js`: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmi.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmi.js)

## Commands

The bot calls commands from the [aoe2.net](https://aoe2.net) [API](https://aoe2.net/#api).

* `commands`
* `match`
* `map`
* `civs`
* `rank`
* `elo`
* `rating`
